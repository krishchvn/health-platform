# How to start 
### Clerk Auth
Sign in to Clerk and you can find VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY in API Keys.
Create a .env file in root folder to store VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishchvn/health-platform.git
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open another terminal
```
cd server
node socket.js
```

# WorkFlow
1. User signs up via Clerk and selects role
2. Role is stored in Clerk metadata ‚Üí redirected to appropriate dashboard
3. If Role == Patient clicks ‚ÄúConsult‚Äù ‚Üí opens chat with selected doctor
   If Role == Doctor sees patients that have consulted and clicks "Open Chat" for further consultation
4. Chat messages and images are:
    4.1 Sent via Socket.io
    4.2 Stored in DynamoDB (via Lambda)
    4.3 Images uploaded to S3 -> trigger EventBridge -> metadata saved in DynamoDB
5. Notification sent to recipient via SNS
6. Doctor and Patient dashboards show real-time chat summaries and latest messages
